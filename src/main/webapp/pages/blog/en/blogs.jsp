                        A condominium’s reserve fund study determines how much money needs to ensure the repairs can be 
                        paid for in the future. CubeDrive helps the engineer translate the reserve fund study from MS Excel 
                        to online application with ease.

                    <p>
                        A reserve fund study is a report that assists condominium corporations in understanding what they own, 
                        how much money they have, the timing of potential replacements, future costs, and, ultimately, how to 
                        pay for the replacements when they are due. A reserve fund study is a financial document that is meant 
                        to act as a guide to assist with planning corporate budgets. This document takes a business approach to reserve fund management.

                    <p>Today most companies still rely on spreadsheets to collect their data. Among many other
                        advantages,

                        The main downside to a spreadsheet-based data solution is the manual labor required to

                        process the data efficiently.

                    <p style="font-size:14px"><span class="far fa-clock"></span> Posted on Dec 15, 2016 at 9:00 AM</p>
                    <p>CubeDrive is pleased to announce that the public beta release of CubeDrive v1.0.0 is now
                        available.
                    <p>We have been hard at work for much of this year building a completely new BPM experience. We
                        re-thought and integrated our three separated products under one umbrella - CubeDrive.
                        The goal is to make the BPM experience easier to use, more flexible, and more productive than
                        ever.
                    <p>There are over a hundred features throughout the application. We’ve designed the UI to not only
                        look more modern, but also let you to create dynamic form-based applications and apply business
                        logic with workflow in minutes.
                    <p> CubeDrive has three main components:

                    <h4><b>Form Designer</b></h4>

                    <p>Cubedrive Form Designer helps you create Forms easily with a simple and intuitive interface.
                        It is easy to get your forms up and running in no time; no programming is required.</p>
                    <p>By default, when a Form is created, Cubedrive will have an EnterpriseSheet Database generated
                        at the back-end to store data submitted through the Form. You need create the Workflow and apply
                        your
                        logic after Form is created.
                    <p><img src="/pages/cases/en/images/form.png" width=500></p>

                    <br>
                    <h4><b>Workflow Manager</b></h4>
                    <p>One of the most important and powerful features of Cubedrive is its ability to create and manage
                        business workflows (conditions, actions, routings and notifications etc) to make your
                        application more powerful and robust.
                    <p>The Workflow Manager provides a drag-and-drop user interface to define the workflows and tasks
                        easily, without any errors.
                    <p><img src="/pages/cases/en/images/purchase-flow.png" width=800></p>

                    <br>
                    <h4><b>EnterpriseSheet Database</b></h4>
                    <p>EnterpriseSheet is an online spreadsheet-like and human-friendly relational database.
                    <p>It is a key component in CubeDrive platform which helps to store, manage, analyze and collaborate
                        your business application data in real time effectively and safely.
                    <p>If you are familiar with Google Sheets or MS spreadsheet, you will feel right at home with
                        EnterpriseSheet.
                        However, EnterpriseSheet is more than a spreadsheet, it is also a relational database. It sticks
                        to relational database basics
                        and its intuitive interface helps data construction and manipulation a breeze.
                    <p><img src="/pages/cases/en/images/purchase-sheet.png" width=800>

                    <p>Give it a shot and let us know what you think. There’s a lot more to come.

                    <p><h4>Important: It’s a Beta!</h4>
