            <h2>Generate condominium’s reserve fund study</h2>
            <p style="font-size:14px"><span class="far fa-clock"></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;June 8th, 2018 by Fenqiang Zhuang @

            <p>
                A reserve fund is used to pay for
                major repairs and replacements to the condominium’s common elements. A portion of the owner’s monthly
                common
                expenses fee is deposited into the reserve fund every month. The reserve fund is intended to ensure that
                the
                corporation has enough money to pay for future repairs.
            </p>

            <h3>Reserve fund study program</h3>
            <hr/>

            <p>
                A reserve fund study determines how much money needs to be in the fund to ensure the repairs can be paid
                for in the future. The reserve fund study must be prepared by a specialist, like an engineer.
                CubeDrive helps the engineer prepare the reserve fund study online with ease.

            <hr/>

            <p>
                Before you create the project and put all data together, you need have the related applications created.
                In this example, the following forms are created:
            </p>
            <ul class="list-style-check-icon">
                <li><a href="https://www.cubedrive.com/lite/app/form/6399624250549866496" target="_blank">Condo list</a>
                    - A from includes all the required condominium information for Reserve Fund Study.
                </li>
                <li><a href="https://www.cubedrive.com/lite/app/form/6401633137834594304" target="_blank">Mechanical

            <h3>Data mining</h3>
            <hr/>
            <p>
                With all raw data input into the system by the engineers, the system will be able to generate the
                Reserve Fund Study result.

            <p>
                Click the "Open in sheet" button; the system will extract the related information from forms and
                generate an online spreadsheet with customer required format for future reference. Customers may
                also export it as a MS Excel file.
